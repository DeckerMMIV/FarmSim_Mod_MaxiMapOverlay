[b][u]Mod description[/u][/b]

Take a look at the screenshots for a much better description of what this mod can do.

In addition to showing the fruit-types and growth-states of crops in the maximized world-map, this mod also allows you to customize the colors of fruits and growth-states.

Please note: Only when on foot (i.e. not driving a vehicle), the mouse-cursor becomes available to allow selecting and editing the colors.
